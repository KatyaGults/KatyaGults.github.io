	<p class="right"> I am a second year student of Communication major, studying in Lithuania at the LCC University. The constant self-growth, curiosity about the world, desire to become a high-quality specialist - are my driven forces in studying. I have many interests, therefore beside the high GPA of 9.94 I am also involved in the community activities, leadership position, and living healthy lifestyle. If I am passionate about an idea I would dedicate 100 % of myself to do my best and use the given opportunities. The approach to studying I have learned at LCC enables me to gain necessary skills and habits to work for the best possible result with wise usage of opportunities and strengths. I am willing to work and contribute to the achievement of the goals of a company and its progress. My core values of responsibility abd loyalty encourage me to do it good, so my job will glorify God. These are the words, but you can check them out! Hire me! </p>
