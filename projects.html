		<h1 class="project-headings"> Retreat Organization </h1>
		<img src="retreat.jpg"/>
		<div id="inside"><p class="projects"> In the 2015-2016 I was a member of the Spiritual Life Team at the LCC University. We were organizing spiritual retreat for tired students, in which I took responsibility for food preparation. I had to create the menu, calculate the amount of ingredients for 60 people, and prepare the food. After a research we have concluded that chili soup in vegetarian and meat-versions would be a good choice for the dinner, and pancakes with toppings for the breakfast. By the careful and thoughtful calculations, skills in cooling, and the help of others we have managed to feed 60 hungry students! Moreover, I suggested to provide a sweet desert with minimum expenses, which also was a pleasant treatment in the evening in addition to rich chili. </p>

		<h2 class="project-headings"> Analysis of Propaganda in Milka brand </h2>
		<img src="milka.jpg"/> 
		<p class="projects"> The analysis of the use of persuasion and propaganda tools in the Milka brand is one of the best my works written so far. The work took more than a month of writing work, including preparatory research, determining key points, incorporating studying material, and final evaluation and conclusions. Milka is a well-known chocolate with over 100 years of history, and it has successfully conquered millions of hearts in Europe. Moreover, in Germany people think of Milka as "the sweetest temptation since chocolate began"! If you are interested why, read my analysis!</p> <a href="Milka.htm">Read me now!</a>

		<h3 class="project-headings"> Collecting presents for the Syrian Children refugees</h3>
		<img src="angel.jpg"/>
		<p class="projects"> Being a sophomore I joined the initiative to organize collection of presents for refugee children in Syria under the project "Angel Tree +". I was involved in organizing and developing the project starting from the logo and finishing with the packing and sending the collected presents from Klaipeda (LT) to Latvia - the official point of collection donations. I have especially concentrated in transporation issues, communication with the interested and influential groups, organizing fundraising events, and the final packaging process. As a result of close cooperation of the dozen of students under the guidance of professor of the leaderships class, we have engaged LCC university, local church, and even some people abroad. Eventually, 268 presents were collected and sent to the refugee children during the Christmas time. It was a great opportunity to serve and to learn about leadership and organization of mass projects. </p>
